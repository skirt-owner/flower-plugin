![Settings Preview](./assets/settings.png)

1. **`FLower Image Size (px)`** - It's the size of an image in range `[10; 1000]`
2. **`Flower Images Folder`** - Here you can specify folder where you want to store generated images in your vault.
> **_Note:_** For example `'flowers'` or `'assets/flowers'` - plugin will create all folders that don't exist.
3. **`Seed from Title with Regex`** - when toggled you'll see a text field where you can specify regex string to get seed from title of a Markdown Note:
> **_Note:_** On default the regex string will consider any first number in title as a seed.

4. **`Seed from Selection with Delimiter`** - when toggled plugin can recognize `<seed value:[1;15 digits]><delimiter><size value:[10;1000]>` selection in the note and generate a flower based on specified values (overrides settings values).
> **_Note:_** You can also use `<seed value><delimiter>` or `<delimiter><size value>` strings, and `size value` will be used based on settings and `seed value` will be taken from title (if **`Seed from Title with Regex`** is toggled) or random one othewise.

5. **`Random Seed`** - pretty straightforward but it will just use random seed value and size specified in settings.

> ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó **(3) and (4) cannot be toggled when (5) is active and vice versa.**
